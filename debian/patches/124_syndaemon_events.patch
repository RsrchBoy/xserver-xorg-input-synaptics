Subject: [PATCH xf86-input-synaptics] Drain XRecord connection of any events after handling replies

If the X server sends an event to the XRecord connection the event
will never be handled. This will cause the event queue to fill up in
Xlib and lead to syndaemon running away at 100% cpu usage.

This change drains any events from the connection. It's not a fix for
the underlying bug in the server or Xlib, but it does paper over the
issue for now.

I'm offering this up as a work around for whatever real bug exists. It
probably should not be committed upstream though.
