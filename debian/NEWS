xserver-xorg-input-synaptics (1.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

 * Tapping has been disabled by default on many touchpads by upstream. If
   you want to re-enable it, you can do so explicitly by adding the
   following to your xorg.conf:
   
        Section "InputDevice"
                Identifier "synaptics"
                Driver "synaptics"
                Option "TapButton1" "1"
                Option "TapButton2" "2"
                Option "TapButton3" "3"
        EndSection

   You may only require one or two TapButton options for your own
   configuration. For more details see synaptics(4) and
